                <br>
                <p>Ans:</p>
                <p>Many posts discuss how to use .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .reduce() and .find() on arrays in JavaScript. I thought it would be useful to provide an explanation of when to use the common array methods. <br>

                    .map(), .filter(), .reduce() and .find() all behave very similarly to .forEach() so for now lets just focus on the latter.</p><br>
                <p>.forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array. Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when you can’t use a more specialized tool.

                    .map() when you want to transform elements in an <br>

                    When to use filter?<br>

                    .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.

                    <br>
                    .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.

                <p>Ans:</p>
                <p>In JavaScript, there are three ways to create strings:

                    Single quotes (‘ ’)
                    Double quotes (“ ”)
                    Backtick literals (``)</p><br>
                    <p>
                        1 — String concatenation (aka variable interpolation)

The big advantage of backtick literals over quotation marks is when it is necessary to insert variables into a string phrase.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>2 — Cleaner code, less escaping with \

                        The other advantage of backtick literals (` `) is not needing to escape double quote (“ ”) or single quote (‘ ’) characters using a backslash (\).</p><br>
